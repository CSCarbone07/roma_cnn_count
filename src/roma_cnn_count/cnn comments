3 other posibilities
intercept one of the maps and determine the confidence from that
add the confidence map as labels and determine the confidence from the output
add the confidence map as labels and determine the confidence AND the counting from the output map


My personal favorite
train a first network section to determine the confidence map
use as training data map with different levels of gaussians correlated to confidence numbers per 

then the second section of the network train to determine the actual number of plants and confidence value per plant. One pixel per plant location means 100% confidence, while full white screen is 0 confidence (not sure how to handle false negatives)

should I train both networks separately?





do I need to save the model or the state_dict?

how to extract one of the 8 maps?



regressor counting network
0-1 hot enconding
the last layer needs to be a softmax
which presents the probabilities for each amount
avoid going above 20 weeds

for conda
it has to be the version 10 of pytorch to fully work

conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch
conda install -c conda-forge tqdm tensorboardx matplotlib scipy parse numpy




add the folders
add in the devkit/ImageSets/Main/
the files for the training and test set
add in devkit/csv the csv files for the boxes as csv

delete files/ files to change max count of classes


which size should it be the input for the network to be reasonable
camera matrix
converter to rgb
at which level should I consider the image for cnn processing, after matrix and rgb?
